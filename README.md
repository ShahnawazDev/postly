- **Infinite Scrolling**: Load more posts as the user scrolls down the list.
- **Local Interactions**: Like and share posts locally (no server update).
- **Offline Support**: Stores up to 5-10 posts in SQLite for offline access.
- **Organizing Posts**: Separate tabs for liked and saved posts.
- **Responsive UI**: Implemented using Flutter widgets to match the provided design.
- **Search & Filter**: Search and filter posts by title, username, or category.
